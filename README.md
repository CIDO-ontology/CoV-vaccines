# CoV-vaccines
Coronavirus vaccines 

Here we collect, model, represent, and analyze experimentally verified coronavirus vaccines. 

This project is a collaboratove project with the Vaccine Ontology (VO) project: https://github.com/vaccineontology/VO. We basically collect coronavirus vaccine results from peer-reviewed studies, represented them in VO, and then import them back to CIDO.
